# Real-Python-Python-Basics-Exercises
Within this repository you will find my documentation of my constructed solutions from learning Python3 via Real Python's "Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3 Book". I purchased the ebook 7/11/2020 and finished it 8/27/2020. Other than documenting my solutions to the provided challenges of the book, this repository has been created to practice using Git and pushing my code to Github.
