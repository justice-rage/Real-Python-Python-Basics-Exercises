# Real-Python-Python-Basics-Exercises
Within this repository you will find my documentation of my introductory projects from learning Python 3 via Real Python's "Python Basics: A Practical Introduction to Python 3 Book". I purchased the ebook 7/11/2020 and finished it 8/27/2020. Other than documenting my solutions to the provided challenges of the book, this repository has been created to practice using Git and pushing my code to Github.

You can find the provided solutions for book at the following link: https://github.com/realpython/python-basics-exercises
