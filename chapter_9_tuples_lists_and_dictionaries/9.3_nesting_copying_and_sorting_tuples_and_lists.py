# 9.3 Nesting, Copying and Sorting Tuples and Lists

# 1) Create a tuple data with two values. The first value should be the 
# tuple (1, 2) and the second value should be the tuple (3, 4) .

# 2) Write a for loop that loops over data and prints the sum of each nested tuple. 
# The output should look like this: 
# Row 1 sum: 3
# Row 2 sum: 7 

# 3) Create the following list [4, 3, 2, 1] and assign it to the variable numbers .

# 4) Create a copy of the numbers list using the [:] slicing notation.

# 5) Sort the numbers list in numerical order using the .sort() method.
