# 8.1 Compare Values

# 1) For each of the following conditional expressions, guess whether they 
# evaluate to True or False . Then type them into the interactive window to
# check your answers:

1 <= 1 # Guess: True
1 != 1 # Guess: False
1 != 2 # Guess: True
"good" != "bad" # Guess: True
"good" != "Good" # Guess: True
123 == "123" # Guess: False

# 2) For each of the following expressions, fill in the blank 
# (indicated by __ ) with an appropriate boolean comparator so 
# that the expression evaluates to True :

3 __ 4 # 3 < 4
10 __ 5 # 10 > 5
"jack" __ "jill" # "jack" != "jill"
42 __ "42" # 42 != "42"
