# 8.4 Challenge: Find the Factors of a Number

""" A factor of a positive integer n is any positive integer less than or 
equal to n that divides n with no remainder.
For example, 3 is a factor of 12 because 12 divided by 3 is 4 , with no 
remainder. However, 5 is not a factor of 12 because 5 goes into 12 twice 
with a remainder of 2 .
Write a program called factors.py that asks the user to input a positive 
integer and then prints out the factors of that number. Hereâ€™s a sample run
of the program with output:

Enter a positive integer: 12
1 is a factor of 12
2 is a factor of 12
3 is a factor of 12
4 is a factor of 12
6 is a factor of 12
12 is a factor of 12

Hint: Recall from Chapter 5 that you can use the % operator to get the 
remainder of dividing one number by another. """
